ANTz - VR
====
ANTz - VR currently (only) supports the [zSpace](https://zspace.com) desktop VR system.

App and code is not yet generally released.

However, if your a zSpace owner, you may contact us and request a working copy of the code.

We plan to release the code in the future, once we separate out proprietary components.
