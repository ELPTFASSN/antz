When editing or creating a new icon you may need to type:

ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache (in a command window)

Otherwise your new icon may appear not to have changed,
 (if the file name of the .exe stays the same.)

---
note that the icon only shows up for the app icon and console window,
not for the main window. The app could be compiled as a window app
instead of a console app, or below are some links that suggest methods 
that could be implemented to set a main window icon with freeglut.
