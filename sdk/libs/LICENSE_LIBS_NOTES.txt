3RD PARTY LIBRARY LICENSING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd party libraries have their own licenses. In general we attempt to only
include libraries that are compatible with open source projects.

However, some libraries have restricted licensing:

- zSpace -
Permission was granted to distribute code that calls the zSpace library,
but you will need to download and install the SDK separately.
 http://zspace.com

- MySQL -
MySQL allows for open source projects to distribute under the GPL, but other
commercial projects generally require an agreement with Oracle.
